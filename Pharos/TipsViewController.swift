Settling In: When you are moving to a new community, it is likely that you are moving with your spouse, son, daughter, grandchildren or friends. Try introducing them to your neighbors! If the presence of your loved ones make you feel more courageous and outgoing, you will surely find it easier to approach new people. \n \n 2. Explore: Do you ever feel that you are not sure of what to do  when you're at home alone? Try taking a walk around your community. If the neighbors see you from their home, they might say hello before you! Check out the communal areas, such as recreation rooms and cafeterias, in your community. See which place you like the most and go there often! \n \n 3. Introduce Yourself: If you are not familiar with most people in your community, break the ice! Maybe start by approaching someone that looks friendly. Tell them your name and share some facts about you. Maybe you will find something in common! Then continue to approach more people. Soon enough, everyone will know your name and some facts about you! \n \n \n Do's and Don't's \n \n 1. DON'T be stuck feeling uncomfortable and self-conscious; DO get familiar with the daily routines and activites in the community. \n \n 2. DON'T think that you are the only one when you feel alone; DO understand that many of your neighbors can relate and are probably in similar situations. \n \n 3. DON'T think that you are any less that the healthier or physically stronger you; DO keep in mind that you are improving and getting better everyday. \n \n 4. DON'T spend all day home thinking about your physical conditions; DO get some fresh air and focus on your hobbies, such as photography, music, or anything that you love."
